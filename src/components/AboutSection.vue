While integrating dustkid.com curated leaderboards into Dustmod and extending the replay system to give richer metadata was an initial goal, the project has expanded to include quite a variety of extended functionality on top of the base game. It\'s my hope that Dustmod continues to be a way to launch deep into the nearly unlimited content that Dustforce and the surrounding community offers.',
